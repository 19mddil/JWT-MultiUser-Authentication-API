# Local Set Up
(I previously had this project in the <https://github.com/19mddil/Django_Framework/tree/master/api_projects/Medi_Project/jwt_authen_project/backend> repo, but now the project worth having a repository for itself.Also I **implemented the same criteria using djangos rest-auth which can be found in this repo**
<https://github.com/19mddil/Django_Framework/tree/master/api_projects/Medi_Project/rest_auth_project/backend> )  
**Run Following Commands in the Terminal**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/19mddil/JWT-MultiUser-Authentication-API.git
```
Then move your cloned directory where you will see manage.py and run following
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
```
## About
I was creating a medical system project where at a point I had to create two users who are doctor and paitent and I also intended to use jwt token authentication system for both users authentication in same project. I was able to do it after some research and logical coding and how I did that the details can be found in my website where I tried to explain.
